# 🌐 Semantic HTML Blog Structure

Welcome to **Semantic HTML Blog Structure** — a clean and meaningful layout for a simple blog page using semantic HTML5 tags. This project is designed to help learners and developers understand how to structure web content with clarity and accessibility in mind.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

This repository contains a single HTML file (`index.html`) that demonstrates:

- Proper use of semantic tags like `header`, `nav`, `main`, `article`, `aside`, and `footer`
- A simple blog layout in Persian (Farsi) language
- Clear separation of content, navigation, and metadata

---

## 🎯 Objectives

✅ Improve semantic clarity of HTML documents  
✅ Enhance accessibility and SEO readiness  
✅ Practice meaningful tag usage in real-world layouts

---

## 📌 Tasks to Complete

- Wrap `h1` and `nav` inside a `header` element  
- Place `h2` and `p` inside an `article` within `main`  
- Move the list of post links into an `aside` within `main`  
- Wrap the final `p` element in a `footer` tag

> 💡 Only changes to `index.html` are allowed.
